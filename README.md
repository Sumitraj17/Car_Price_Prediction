# Car Price Prediction Model

This GitHub repository contains a simple yet effective car price prediction model based on linear regression. The model is designed to predict the price of cars based on various features such as mileage, brand, model year, and more.

## Overview

Car price prediction is a common task in the field of machine learning and data science. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a linear regression model for predicting car prices. Linear regression is a straightforward algorithm that establishes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable (car price, in this case).

## Usage

To use this model and predict car prices, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sumitraj17/Car_Price_Prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `car_price_prediction.ipynb`:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook car_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```

   Follow the instructions and code within the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is included in the `data` folder. It contains information about various cars, including features such as mileage, brand, model year, etc. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Model Performance

The performance of the linear regression model is assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. You can find these metrics in the notebook after training the model.

## Future Improvements

This project serves as a starting point for car price prediction. There are several opportunities for improvement, including:

- Feature engineering: Experiment with additional features or transformations to enhance model performance.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tune the model parameters for better predictive accuracy.
- Explore other algorithms: Consider trying more advanced machine learning algorithms to compare performance.

Feel free to contribute to the project by opening issues, suggesting improvements, or adding new features.

Happy predicting! ðŸš—ðŸ’°
